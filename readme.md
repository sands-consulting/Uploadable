# Uploader Trait for Laravel Models

This package is to simplify upload handling in a Laravel application. Should work for both Laravel 5 and Lumen.

Key features:
1. Simple to use
2. Extendable
3. Handles both single and multiple uploads

## Core Concepts

1. All uploads belongs to a record in the database
2. File upload handling, manipulation and saving are done by passing it through a set of filters in series (Ã  la gulp).
3. You can create your own filters.

## Installation

1. Install it in your application: `composer require sands/uploadable`
2. Add `Sands\Uploadable\UploadableServiceProvider::class` into your `app/config/app.php` file, inside the `providers` array.
3. Publish the package's migration: `php artisan vendor:publish`.
4. Run `php artisan migrate` to create the `uploads` table.

## Usage

Use the `UploadableTrait` trait inside your `model`

```php
use Sands\Uploadable\UploadableTrait;
class Task extends Model
{
    use UploadableTrait;   
    ...
}
```

Add a `$uploadableConfig` array property inside your `model` file: 

```php 
protected $uploadableConfig = [
	// handle <input type="file" name="images"/> or <input type="file" name="images[]" multiple/>
    'images' => [
        'fix-image-orientation', // fixes the image orientation
        'save',                  // saves the image prefixed wth "original-"
        'resize-image:800',      // resize the image to 800px width, maintain aspect ratio
        'save:medium',           // saves the image prefixed with "medium-"
        'resize-image:400',      // resize the image to 400px width, maintain aspect ratio
        'save:small',            // saves the image prefixed with "small-"
        'thumbnail-image:140',   // creates a 140px x 140px thumbnail of the image, resized then center cropped
        'save:thumbnail',        // saves the image prefixed with "thumbnail-"
    ],
    // handle <input type="file" name="images[main]"/> use 'dot' notation
    'images.main' => [
        ...
    ],
];
``` 

In the model's boot method, listen for `saved` and `deleted` events to `attach` and `detach` files to the `model`:

```php
public static function boot()
{
    self::saved(function (Task $task) {
        $task->attachFiles();
    });
    self::deleted(function (Task $task) {
        $task->detachFiles();
    });
}
```

Whenever the model is saved, this package will look for any matching `uploadableConfig` with the request. If there are any, the uploaded file will be passed through the configured filter. Each t 

## Built-in Filters

### Fix Image Orientation Filter

Fixes the image orientation.

Filter name: `fix-image-orientation`

### Resize Image Filter

Manipulates the image size.

Filter name: `resize-image`

Filter arguments:

1. `number` `default: 800` Target width in pixels 
2. `number` `default: 800` Target height in pixels
3. `boolean` `default: true` Constrain the aspect ratio while resizing
4. `boolean` `default: false` Constrain upsize. Do not upsize the image while resizing

### Thumbnail Image Filter

Manipulates the image to be resized and center cropped.

Filter name: `thumbnail-image`

Filter arguments:

1. `number` `default: 140` Target width and height in pixels 
2. `string` `default: #000000` Fill with this color if there is empty area after cropping

### Save Filter

Saves the modified image into an obfuscated directory inside the `public/uploads` directory. Each time the `save` filter is triggered, a new entry will be inserted into the `uploads` table.

Filter name: `save`

Filter arguments:

1. `string` `default: original-` Prefixes the file name with this string.


## Getting Uploads Related to a Model

Relationship between a `model` and `uploads` are implemented with the simple Laravel's `morphMany` method. You can access the files simply by `$task->uploads`. This will return all files and their mutations related to a `model`.

To filter through the files related to a `model` you can simply do `$task->uploads()->where() ... `.

There is also a shorthand `files($type = null, $prefix = null)` method that takes `$type` argument where it filters the type of file uploaded (`images` in the above example) and `$prefix` argument where it will search for uploads with the prefix. This method will return an `Eloquent` query so you can further refine the search.

The `upload` object properties are as per below:

```json
{
     "id": 5,
     "uploadable_type": "App\\Task",
     "uploadable_id": "2",
     "type": "images",
     "name": "original-2016-03-12-121732-am.png",
     "mime_type": "image/png",
     "url": "/uploads/MjAxNjAz/YXBwdGFzazI,/original-2016-03-12-121732-am.png",
     "path": "/var/www/project/public/uploads/MjAxNjAz/YXBwdGFzazI,/original-2016-03-12-121732-am.png",
     "created_at": "2016-03-30 21:52:20",
     "updated_at": "2016-03-30 21:52:20",
}
```

Example for getting an uploaded image's URL:

```php
<ul>
@foreach($tasks as $task)
    <li>
    	<img src="{{$task->files(null, 'thumbnail-')->first()->url}}" alt="">
        {{$task->name}}
    </li>
@endforeach
</ul>
```

## Creating Your Own Filter

It is very easy to create your own filter:

1. Create a `class` that implements `Sands\Uploadable\FilterInterface`.
2. Register the filter: `app('uploadable')->registerFilter('filterName', 'filterClass')`.
3. There is no step 3.

For example, lets say that we want to rotate all uploaded images by a certain configurable degrees:

Create a `RotateImage` class:

```php
namespace App\Filters\RotateImage;
use Sands\Uploadable\FilterInterface;

class RotateImage implements FilterInterface
{
    public function process($type, $file, $model)
    {
        $image = app('image')->make($file->getPathname());
        $image->rotate($this->degrees);
        $image->save();
    }

    public function __construct($degrees = 0)
    {
        $this->degrees = $degrees;
    }
}
```

Register the filter:

```php
namespace App\Providers;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use App\Filters\RotateImage;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        app('uploadable')->registerFilter('rotate-image', RotateImage::class);
    }
    ....
}
```

Use it in your model:

```php
use Sands\Uploadable\UploadableTrait;
class Task extends Model
{
    use UploadableTrait;
    protected $uploadableConfig = [
        'images' => [
            'rotate-image:63', // rotate the image by 63 degrees
            'save',            // save the image
        ],
    ];
    ...   
}
```

Thats it!
